## AI Integration Tools

### Continue.dev

Continue.dev connects to your local Ollama models and provides these key features:

#### Codebase Search
Use `@codebase` followed by your search query to find code across your project:

```
@codebase find authentication functions
@codebase where is the database initialized
@codebase how does error handling work
```

#### Code Commands
Continue.dev provides several slash commands for code operations:

- `/explain` - Explain selected code in detail
- `/refactor` - Refactor selected code
- `/test` - Generate tests for selected code
- `/fix` - Fix issues in selected code
- `/document` - Generate documentation
- `/improve` - Suggest improvements

#### Context Window
Continue.dev automatically tracks your editing context and provides relevant suggestions based on your current work.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd+L` - Open Continue chat
- `Cmd+Shift+L` - Send selection to Continue
- `Cmd+Alt+L` - Generate code in current position

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot provides cloud-based AI assistance with these features:

#### Inline Suggestions
As you type, Copilot will suggest code completions that you can accept with `Tab`.

#### Copilot Chat
Use `Cmd+I` to open Copilot Chat with these special commands:

- `@workspace` - Ask about your workspace code
- `/fix` - Fix code issues
- `/explain` - Explain code
- `/tests` - Generate tests
- `/doc` - Generate documentation

#### Workspace Understanding
Copilot can understand your entire workspace context, making it useful for:
- Understanding project architecture
- Finding relevant files
- Explaining relationships between components

## Using AI Effectively

### Best Practices

1. **Start with local models** for code-related tasks to maintain privacy
2. **Use Copilot** for more complex tasks that might exceed local model capabilities
3. **Chain prompts** by building on previous responses
4. **Be specific** about programming language, style, and patterns
5. **Provide context** by explaining the project or problem
6. **Review all AI-generated code** carefully before using it

### Model Selection Guide

| Task | Recommended Model | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| Code completion | CodeLlama 7B | Specialized in code understanding |
| Quick command help | Llama 3.2 3B | Fast responses, sufficient for simple tasks |
| Project planning | Gemma 3 4B | Better conceptual understanding |
| Algorithm design | DeepSeek R1 | Strong reasoning capabilities |
| Complex systems | GitHub Copilot | Larger context window, more parameters |
| Codebase search | Nomic Embed | Optimized for embeddings and search |

### Common Workflows

#### Starting a New Project
1. Use `create-project` to scaffold the project
2. Use Gemma 3 for architectural planning
3. Use CodeLlama for core functionality implementation
4. Use Copilot for complex integration challenges

#### Debugging Workflow
1. Use `/explain` to understand problematic code
2. Use DeepSeek R1 to analyze logic issues
3. Use `/fix` to generate potential fixes
4. Use CodeLlama to implement and test solutions

#### Learning New Technologies
1. Use Gemma 3 to explain core concepts
2. Use CodeLlama to generate example code
3. Use Copilot Chat to ask follow-up questions
4. Use local models to experiment with implementations
